## Hello there!

My name is Eduardo, and I am a mathematics and computer science undergraduate
student at UFABC. I currently work as a full stack software engineer at Vizir
Software Studio, mainly using TypeScript, React and Node.js.

My biggest interests in math reside mainly in topology, category theory and
logic. In computer science, I really like computer graphics, programming
language theory, computer architecture and operating systems.

My favorite programming languages are Rust, Haskell and C.

I use GNU/Linux ~(arch btw)~, with Neovim as my text editor and xmonad as my
window manager. Depending on my mood, I'll use Emacs as my IDE (with evil-mode,
of course!).

I occasionaly write posts at [my blog](https://edurenesto.github.io). It's a
bit dead at the moment, but currently I'm migrating it from Zola to Hakyll and
also preparing some posts. I intend on writing about computer science, math,
music and some politics.

If you want to reach me, feel free to DM me at my
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Edu_Renesto).

My pronouns are he/they.

Thanks for coming by, have a nice day! ðŸ¦€
